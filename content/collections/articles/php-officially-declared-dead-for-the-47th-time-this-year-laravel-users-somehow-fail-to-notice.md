In a shocking turn of events that has become a bi-monthly tradition in the tech world, PHP has once again been officially declared dead. This time, the proclamation came from a consortium of opinionated developers who have never actually used PHP but are certain it's terrible.

"We're absolutely positive that PHP is dead this time," declared Chad Trendsetter, a self-proclaimed 'JavaScript Evangelist' who updates his preferred JS framework hourly. "We've been saying it's dead for the past 15 years, so probability suggests we must be right eventually."

The announcement has been met with confusion by the millions of developers still actively using PHP, particularly those working with the hugely popular Laravel framework. "Wait, PHP is dead? Again?" asked Sarah CodeSlinger, a senior Laravel developer. "That's weird, because I just pushed a PHP update to our app that handles 10 million daily users. Must be some really active zombies using our platform."

Laravel, the PHP framework that apparently didn't get the memo about its language's demise, continues to thrive. "We're seeing record numbers of developers adopting Laravel," said Taylor Otwell, Laravel's creator, from atop a mountain of PHP-based websites. "But I guess if a bunch of React developers say PHP is dead, it must be true. We'll just have to break it to our millions of users gently."

The death of PHP has had some unexpected consequences:

- WordPress, which powers 40% of the internet, has decided to rebuild its entire platform in Brainfuck "because at least it's not dead."
- Facebook, largely built on PHP, has announced it will now deliver personalized ads via morse code.
- Millions of PHP developers worldwide have reported feeling like Bruce Willis in "The Sixth Sense."

Despite these challenges, Laravel users remain strangely productive. "I was going to tell my team that our entire stack is dead," said Mike Codebase, a tech lead at a major e-commerce site. "But we were too busy shipping features and scaling our application to attend the funeral."

In response to the news, the PHP community has announced plans to rename the language to "Schrödinger's Code" – simultaneously dead and alive, depending on whether you've actually used it recently.

As the tech world continues to grapple with PHP's latest death, Laravel developers are advised to stay indoors, keep coding, and avoid making eye contact with Rust evangelists. Meanwhile, JavaScript developers are already preparing next week's "PHP is dead" announcement, to be delivered via a 1.5GB Electron app.
